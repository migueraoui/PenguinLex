# PenguinLex - Linux Dictionary

## Description
Linux Dictionary is a Python-based application designed to provide definitions for common Linux-related terms. This project is an open-source effort to help both the Algerian community and the global open-source community understand Linux concepts and improve their skills.

Currently, the dictionary contains terms such as `apt`, `bash`, `sudo`, and others. The future plan is to extend the dictionary with XML integration, allowing us to easily add and manage terms from various Linux books. This will make the dictionary more dynamic and extensible.

## Features:
- A simple Python-based dictionary with Linux-related terms and their definitions.
- Current dictionary stored in a Python file, but future plans to integrate XML support for term management.
- Aimed at helping the Algerian community and the open-source community.
- Open to contributions for expanding terms and improving functionality.

## Future Enhancements:
- Integrating XML files to manage and retrieve Linux-related terms dynamically.
- Accessing terms from Linux books in XML format.
- Improved user interaction and search functionality.

## How to Contribute:
- Fork this repository, make your changes (add new terms or fix existing definitions), and submit a pull request.
- Contributions of any kind, such as bug fixes or feature enhancements, are always welcome.
